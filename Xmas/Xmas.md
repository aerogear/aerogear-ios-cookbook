Xmas
==============
Chrismas is coming - sooner or later :)

Let's help Santa Claus to keep his gifts list secure. We want to achieve local encryption of the present description but keep information like to whom the present is for, clear and searchable. Let's see how we encrypt some data into local storage.

Xmas app shows you how to use [aerogear-crypto-ios](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-crypto-ios). Using AeroGear crypto lib, you can easily do private key encryption (also called symmetric encryption).

## Install
All our project require [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) for dependency management;

**Before**, you can run the apps, you need to run the following command:

    pod install

After that you just need to open the ```Xmas.xcworkspace``` file in XCode and you're all set.
## UI Fow 
When you start the application you will first see a collection list of cards (with ramdom xmas images on the back). If the app is launched for the first time the list is empty. 

To enter a new present, hit the plus sign on the top bar. You enter the name to whom the present is for, a description and your secure your present with a password. Once added, a new card is displayed in the collection view. To flip the card you will be pompted to enter your password. If you use a wrong password, the present description will not be displayed. you can encrypt each present with a different password if you wish but make sure you will remember it.

## Encryption Flow

### Derive Key from password
First of all, to encrypt your data you need an **encryption key**. Your key can be derived from your password using [AGPBKDF2](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-crypto-ios/Classes/AGPBKDF2.html). 

	-(NSData*) getKeyFromPassword:(NSString*)password {
	    AGPBKDF2* derivator = [[AGPBKDF2 alloc] init];
	    
	    return [derivator deriveKey:password salt:_salt];
	}

For random generation of key, salt or IV, use [AGRandomGenerator](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-crypto-ios/Classes/AGRandomGenerator.html). By default, AGRandomGenerator generates 16 bytes key, but you can also specify the length if you wish.

    NSUserDefaults *defaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults];
    
    _salt = [defaults objectForKey:@"xmas.salt"];
    
    if(!_salt) { // if first launch, initialize params for subsequent reads
        _salt = [AGRandomGenerator randomBytes];
        [defaults setObject:_salt forKey:@"xmas.salt"];
        [defaults synchronize];
    }

You need to store your **salt** to be able to regenerate the exact same key when you want to decript this description information. In this example, we've chosen to store this information in NSUserDefaults.

### Encrypt
Once you've got your encryption key, use [AGSecretBox](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-crypto-ios/Classes/AGSecretBox.html) to do the actual encryption.

With [AGSecretBox](http://aerogear.org/docs/specs/aerogear-crypto-ios/Classes/AGSecretBox.html), you can encrypt/decrypt data using your encryption key and a randomly generated IV (Initialization Vector) as shown below:

	-(void) saveAndEncryptData:(id)gift withPassword:password {
	    // Generate key from pasword
	    NSData* key = [self getKeyFromPassword:password];
	    
	    // Use AGSecretBox to encrypt/decrypt data
	    AGSecretBox* secretBox = [[AGSecretBox alloc] initWithKey:key];
	    
	    // transform string to data
	    NSData* dataToEncrypt = [gift[@"description"] dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
	    
	    // encrypt data
	    gift[@"description"] = [secretBox encrypt:dataToEncrypt IV:_IV];
	    
	    // Store data with encrypted description
	    [_store save:gift error:nil];
	    
	    [self.gifts addObject:gift];
	}

Same as for the salt, IV need to be store to be able to decrypt the encrypted data. Salt and IV are not security sensitive in the sense that they can be stored. Do not store password or encryption key.

### Decrypt

To be able to decrypt, you need the randomly generated IV so that you can regenerate the key with the salt and the password (prompted on the fly). You also need the randomly generated IV.
It is not recommended to store either password or derived key. Salt and IV are not security sensitive in the sense that they can be stored.

	-(NSString*)decrypt:(NSData*)data {
	    NSData* key = [self getKeyFromPassword:_password];
	    AGSecretBox* secretBox = [[AGSecretBox alloc] initWithKey:key];

	    return [[NSString alloc]
	            initWithData:[secretBox decrypt:data IV:_IV] encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
	}
